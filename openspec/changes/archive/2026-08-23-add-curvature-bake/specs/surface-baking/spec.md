# surface-baking — curvature maps

Delta for `add-curvature-bake`.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Curvature and cavity maps
The bake stage SHALL bake a curvature map from the Target onto the EditMesh's
UV layout: signed surface curvature encoded around a midpoint gray, with
convex regions brighter and concave regions darker, normalized by a
user-controllable curvature range. A cavity variant SHALL also be available
that encodes concavity only (flat and convex regions map to white), suitable
for direct use as a multiply mask.

When the curvature range is left at 0 the bake SHALL derive it from the Target
as a percentile of |curvature| weighted by the surface area each sample speaks
for, so a region influences the range in proportion to the area it covers and
not to the number of vertices sitting on it.

Curvature baking SHALL follow the same rules as the other map types: the same
cage projection, component links, output resolution up to at least 4096²,
GPU dispatch with progress reporting and cancellation, and PNG/EXR output.

#### Scenario: Curvature bake distinguishes edges from crevices
- **WHEN** a curvature bake runs against a Target with both sharp convex edges and deep concave seams
- **THEN** the convex edges SHALL read brighter than the midpoint and the concave seams darker, at the requested resolution

#### Scenario: Cavity variant masks concavity only
- **WHEN** a cavity bake runs on the same Target
- **THEN** concave seams SHALL read dark while flat and convex regions read white

#### Scenario: Auto range is not captured by a dense sliver fan
- **WHEN** an auto-ranged curvature bake runs against a Target whose parameterization piles a large share of its vertices onto a vanishing share of its area, such as the sliver fans at a UV sphere's poles
- **THEN** the range SHALL be set by the curvature of the bulk of the surface, leaving the interior detail legible rather than compressed toward the midpoint

#### Scenario: Curvature respects the cage
- **WHEN** the projection cage is edited and the curvature bake re-runs
- **THEN** the sampled regions SHALL follow the edited cage exactly as a normal-map bake would
